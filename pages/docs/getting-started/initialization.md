# Initialization

After the deployment is complete, you need to initialize Aurora with your first user, the procedure is very simple.

Go to your Aurora setup URL, if you are following the tutorial the URL will be:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/setup
```

An initialization wizard will appear to you, something like this:

Click the Initialize Database button, this will create all the database stuff which Aurora needs.

> Remember, if you have a different database connection string, update the connection string before proceeding with the setup!

Next, Aurora will ask you to create a user to get started, insert an email and a password.
