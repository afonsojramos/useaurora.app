# Ghost Blog

Ghost is a complete platform to run an independent media business, whether you're just getting started as a creator, or scaling to millions of dollars a year in recurring revenue.

### Requirements

- Running Aurora Instance
- Running Ghost Instance

### Get the Aurora Tracking Code

To connect your ghost instance with Aurora it will be necessary to obtain the tracking code, you can obtain it by creating a new website directly from the Aurora control panel. Please refer to the add a website section.

### Use Ghost Code Injection

In Ghost you can inject code across your entire site or on an individual post or page. Since Aurora needs to track analytics across your entire site, we’ll use the global code injection feature which can be found in the Ghost Admin settings menu.

Aurora requires the tracking code to be in the `<head>` of each page on your site, so paste it into the **Header** section and hit save.

All done! Your site is now fully integrated with Aurora. Login to your Aurora dashboard and start monitoring your site’s metrics!
